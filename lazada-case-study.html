                <p>As a UX Designer at Ant Financial, I collaborated with cross-regional teams including the China and Vietnam, as well as the Lazada design team to lead a comprehensive redesign of Lazada's payment system across six Southeast Asian countries.</p>
                <p>The project addressed significant challenges, including low online payment adoption, heavy reliance on cash-on-delivery, and fragmented payment methods.</p>
                <p>Through strategic planning, user research, and iterative design, we delivered a unified payment experience that increased wallet usage by 17% and reduced cash-on-delivery transactions by 14%.</p>

            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>In 2018, Alibaba acquired Lazada, Southeast Asia's leading e-commerce platform, serving over 60 million users across six countries. To integrate with Alibaba's advanced infrastructure, the platform underwent a major migration project called "Voyager".</p>
            <p>During the preliminary assessment, significant payment challenges emerged. Despite being the region's #1 shopping app, Lazada struggled with low online payment adoption, heavy reliance on cash-on-delivery (COD), fragmented payment methods across different countries, and limited digital wallet usage.</p>
            <p>As a UX Designer, I focused on E-commerce Payment (ECP) solutions for global merchants outside mainland China, with Lazada as our primary initiative in Southeast Asia.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="case-study-section">
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our mission was clear but challenging by completely revamp Lazada's payment system to address several critical business goals:</p>
            
            <div class="key-points">
                <ul>
                    <li>Streamline the checkout flow to improve success rates, especially in Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam, where online payments were significantly underutilized.</li>
                    <li>Redesign the Wallet experience to drive adoption and reduce reliance on offline payment methods.</li>
                    <li>Reduce operational costs by decreasing cash-on-delivery (COD) transactions.</li>
                    <li>Optimize the mobile payment experience, as mobile rapidly became the dominant shopping channel.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <img src="assets/laz-3.jpg" alt="Lazada payment system business goals and objectives">
            </div>

            <p>We faced complex challenges, including:</p>
            
            <div class="key-points">
                <ul>
                    <li>Fragmented payment ecosystems exist across six countries, each with different banking infrastructures.</li>
                    <li>Limited real-time online payment options, often with low success rates.</li>
                    <li>Early-stage digital wallet adoption, requiring incentives and user education.</li>
                    <li>Underdeveloped banking technology created friction in payment experiences.</li>
                    <li>Low consumer trust in online payment security.</li>
                </ul>

        <div class="case-study-section">
            <h2>Transforming Lazada Payment Experience at Scale</h2>

            <h3>Strategic Planning & Team Collaboration</h3>
            <p>Rather than tackling all six countries simultaneously, we prioritized one country with the most diverse payment methods.</p>
            <p>This allowed us to establish a scalable foundation for other markets. We divided responsibilities between our Vietnam and China design teams, one focusing on Payment Checkout and the other on Wallet. The purpose was to accelerate progress while maintaining alignment through regular syncs.</p>

            <div class="case-study-image">
                <img src="assets/laz-2.jpg" alt="Team collaboration and responsibility distribution">
            </div>

            <h3>Understanding User Behavior & Market</h3>
            <p>We conducted several design workshops and local payment research to understand the user behavior, key pain points in the payment experience, focusing more on local solutions.</p>

            <div class="case-study-image">
                <img src="assets/laz-4.jpg" alt="User behavior research and market analysis findings">
            </div>

            <h3>Developing a Unified Design System</h3>
            <p>At that time, we were a small team struggling to maintain design consistency. The designers were familiar with Sketch Symbols, which worked well individually but became challenging when multiple designers collaborated on the same project.</p>
            <p>To prevent that, I established a Design System following Atomic Design Methodology. This created a shared language for our teams, streamlining collaboration between our team.</p>

            <div class="case-study-image">
                <img src="assets/laz-5.jpg" alt="Lazada Design System based on Atomic Design Methodology">
            </div>

            <h3>Creating Tailored Payment Solutions</h3>
            <p>We designed mobile-first solutions to meet specific user needs:</p>
            <div class="key-points">
                <ul>
                    <li>Personalized payment recommendations based on user behavior, location, and past choices.</li>
                    <li>Wallet benefit highlights to drive adoption and reduce reliance on COD.</li>
                    <li>Incentives to reduce COD usage, emphasizing the benefits of digital payments.</li>
                    <li>Stronger trust and security signals, including certificates, protection guarantees, and clear payment information.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            </div>

            <h3>Testing & Refinement</h3>
            <p>We conducted 39 usability tests across five countries over 19 days, with 8 other field research sessions. Collaborating with local customer service teams, we:</p>
            <div class="key-points">
                <ul>
                    <li>Defined targeted user groups to maximize testing effectiveness.</li>
                    <li>Developed interactive prototypes that evolved with each testing round.</li>
                    <li>Gathered user feedback, directly shaping design iterations.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <img src="assets/laz-8.jpg" alt="Design iteration">
            </div>

            <h3>Implementation & User Acceptance Testing</h3>
            <p>Once designs were finalized, I worked closely with developers to ensure seamless execution:</p>
            <div class="key-points">
                <ul>
                    <li>Provided detailed design specs and participated in technical feasibility discussions.</li>
                    <li>Led User Acceptance Testing (UAT) across multiple countries, personally walking through test cases as an end user.</li>
                    <li>Worked with engineers to resolve bugs and ensure design integrity.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Post-Launch Monitoring & Optimization</h3>
            <p>Beyond launch, I remained actively involved in performance optimization along with Product Managers and Engineers:</p>
            <div class="key-points">
                <ul>
                    <li>Collaborated with Product Managers to analyze tracking data and identify optimization opportunities.</li>
                    <li>Worked closely with Engineers to implement quick fixes and performance improvements.</li>
                    <li>Partnered with Customer Service to gather user feedback and drive continuous improvement.</li>
                    <li>Led design iterations based on post-launch metrics and team insights to enhance the experience.</li>
                </ul>
