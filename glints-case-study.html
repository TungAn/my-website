                <p>I joined Glints in Q2 2022 to expand their existing mobile app into the Vietnam market. Shortly after, I took on a larger opportunity to lead a design transformation to redefine the job-matching experience for the overall Southeast Asia market.</p>
                <p>By shifting from Resume-based applications to Chat-driven interactions, my design contributed to overall matching efficiency by 64%, driving a sustained 16% Month-over-Month growth.</p>
                <p>This change also accelerated employer response times, nearly doubling the percentage of applications processed within a day from 9.7% to 18.4%. The initiative aligned with Glints' vision of a mobile-first strategy and an SME-friendly job platform.</p>

            <h2>The Transformation Process</h2>
            
            <h3>Start with an MVP</h3>
            <p>From strategic alignment, the leadership wanted to explore a new way to replace the current recruitment behavior, which relied heavily on resumes.</p>
            <p>I led a comprehensive research initiative combining quantitative and qualitative methods to understand user behavior, pain points, and market trends.</p>

            <div class="case-study-image">

            </div>

            <h3>The Human Story: Young Talent Struggling to Get Noticed</h3>
            <p>Through user interviews, I met Tuan Anh, a 22-year-old recent graduate in Ho Chi Minh City, who shared a common frustration:</p>
            <div class="quotes">
                <div class="quote">
                    <p>"I've applied to dozens of jobs and mostly use my laptop due to its convenience. However, I rarely hear back. Employers view my resume, but nothing happens. I don't even know if my resume is good enough or if I'm missing something important."</p>
                    <cite>- Tuan Anh</cite>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>This lack of feedback and uncertainty was a recurring theme across interviews, mirroring inefficiencies in traditional job platforms.</p>

            <h3>From the Data: Identifying the Core Problem</h3>
            <div class="key-points">
                <ul>
                    <li>80% of signed-up users didn't apply on their 1st day, where 50% of them view the job details but drop off.</li>
                    <li>20% of applications being processed, result is lacking response from employers.</li>
                    <li>Only 8% of new applicants return to apply again, demonstrating the low user engagement and negative overall experience.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>Additionally, most job searches relied on keyword-based matching, favoring large enterprises with internal hiring systems. This made them less engaged with platforms and slower to respond to candidates.</p>
            
            <div class="case-study-image">
                <img src="assets/glints-3.jpg" alt="Glints core problem analysis and data insights">
            </div>

            <p>In China, 51Job and Zhilian struggled with the same challenges due to a passive, one-sided job search experience.</p>

            <h3>Market Validation: Lessons from China's Hiring Evolution</h3>
            <p>In the 2010s, Boss Zhipin disrupted China's recruitment industry by replacing resume-based applications with real-time chat, making the hiring process faster and more engaging.</p>
            <p>The market shifted to mobile-first job-seeking, with Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) driving demand. As a result:</p>
            <div class="key-points">
                <ul>
                    <li>Direct chat increased engagement, boosting daily app opens to 8.1x compared to 4-6x on traditional platforms.</li>
                    <li>SMEs rapidly adopted chat-based hiring, with 97% of Boss Zhipin's paying employers being small businesses.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>These insights reinforced our strategy: A mobile-first, chat-driven hiring model could significantly boost engagement and response rates in Southeast Asia.</p>

            <h3>The Turning Point: Testing the Chat-Based Model</h3>
            <p>To test our innovative approach, I designed and collaborated with engineering teams to develop a minimum viable product (MVP) - a lightweight chat-based system integrated into the current system. We carefully rolled out this MVP to a specific user segment, meticulously measuring engagement and conversion rates.</p>
            <p>The results were transformative:</p>
            <div class="key-points">
                <ul>
                    <li>Matching efficiency 2x compared to traditional application methods</li>
                    <li>Shortlisted applications increased from approximately 10% to 40%</li>
                    <li>User interviews revealed overwhelmingly positive feedback, with candidates appreciating the chat feature's seamless integration</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>Candidates specifically noted the chat interface as a safe, convenient communication channel that provides faster updates and more direct interaction with potential employers.</p>
            <div class="quotes">
                <div class="quote">
                    <p>"I expect to use the chat to increase the chance to be seen by employers. So Increase the chance of getting hired"</p>
