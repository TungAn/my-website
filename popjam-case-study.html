                <p>PopJam is a social network for children under 13 that enables them to create and share art, photos, and more in a safe environment. Originally launched in Europe, I was part of the team that adapted and launched PopJam in Vietnam in June 2017, achieving over 1 million users in just 8 months.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="case-study-section">
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>After years of success in European markets, SuperAwesome set out to launch an Asian version of PopJam. Our small development team in Vietnam was given control over adapting the product for local markets.</p>
            
            <h3>Business Goals</h3>
            <div class="key-points">
                <ul>
                    <li>Develop a fully-featured social network tailored to Asian children's preferences and behaviors.</li>
                    <li>Rapidly grow the user base to attract major kid-focused brands and publishers.</li>
                    <li>Expand the kid-safe advertising business in the region.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>The Challenge</h3>
            <div class="key-points">
                <ul>
                    <li>Different user behaviors – Western and Asian children engage with digital content in distinct ways.</li>
                    <li>Intuitive UI for young users – Features had to be simple and easy to navigate.</li>
                    <li>Child safety as the top priority – Every design decision had to ensure strict compliance with safety standards.</li>
                    <li>Resource constraints – Limited budget and development capacity for testing and iteration.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="case-study-section">
            <h2>Making It Happen</h2>

            <h3>Research: Understanding Asian Kids as Users</h3>
            <p>Designing for children required a deep understanding of how they think, interact, and engage with digital products. Since this was my first time designing for kids, I conducted several research approaches:</p>
            <div class="key-points">
                <ul>
                    <li>Observed online videos of children using digital products.</li>
                    <li>Studied child psychology materials related to digital interaction.</li>
                    <li>Interviewed children to understand their preferences and frustrations.</li>
                    <li>Gathered insights from colleagues' children.</li>
                    <li>Analyzed competitor apps popular with Asian children.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h4>Key Insights</h4>
            <div class="key-points">
                <ul>
                    <li>Asian children preferred video content over text-based interactions.</li>
                    <li>Kids were drawn to colorful, animated, and interactive interfaces with sound.</li>
                    <li>Simple, clear interactions kept engagement high.</li>
                    <li>Gamification elements, such as challenges and achievement recognition, were highly appealing.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Product Strategy: Finding Our "Killer Feature"</h3>
            <p>Our leadership initially wanted to pivot toward a video-focused app with social features. However, there are major challenges:</p>
            <div class="key-points">
                <ul>
                    <li>Development Effort: The video features required extra resources we didn't have.</li>
                    <li>Licensing: Video content would be costly to produce.</li>
                    <li>Market competition: Directly competing with established video platforms wasn't feasible.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>Through team brainstorming sessions, we finalized an alternative approach: "Kid Challenges." Inspired by the popularity of kid influencers in Vietnam engaging their audiences with creative challenges, this feature aligned with our strengths and market demand.</p>

            <h3>Design Execution: Balancing Creativity with Feasibility</h3>
            <p>Leveraging my background in software development, I acted as a bridge between design and engineering, ensuring our creative ideas were both user-centric and technically feasible within our constraints.</p>
            <div class="key-points">
                <ul>
                    <li>Rapid prototyping with wireframes to explore and refine ideas.</li>
                    <li>Comprehensive design specifications to align developers and streamline implementation.</li>
                    <li>Optimized visual hierarchy to balance aesthetics, usability, and performance.</li>
                    <li>Version tracking to manage design iterations efficiently and minimize inconsistencies.</li>
                    <li>A/B testing and internal reviews to validate and refine interactions before launch.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Solving Critical Problems: The Signup Flow Crisis</h3>
            <p>After the launch, analysis revealed a high drop-off rate during the sign-up process.</p>
            <p>Investigating the issue, I identified two major problems:</p>
            <div class="key-points">
                <ul>
                    <li>Lack of guidance: Kids didn't understand how to fix errors in usernames and profile setup.</li>
                    <li>Interface breakage: On some devices, the keyboard covered critical buttons, preventing progression.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>To resolve this, I proposed a new signup flow that led to a significant reduction in signup errors from 5% to 1.5%:</p>
            <div class="key-points">
                <ul>
                    <li>New inline error messages with simple, actionable guidance.</li>
                    <li>Smart suggestions to help kids easily fix issues.</li>
                    <li>Ensure critical buttons remained visible, even when the keyboard appeared.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Beyond Design: Supporting Content Creation</h3>
            <p>To help the operation team work more efficiently, I developed an in-house image editor tool, enabling our non-technical content team to quickly create engaging content, including:</p>
            <div class="key-points">
                <ul>
                    <li>Design Roundups: Showcasing top user creations.</li>
                    <li>Daily Winners: Highlighting standout participants.</li>
                    <li>Hall of Fame: Celebrating long-term engagement and achievements.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>I also built HTML5 games and interactive content using the Phaser game engine, allowing us to deliver engaging experiences despite a small team size.</p>
        </div>
